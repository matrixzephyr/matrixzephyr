Greetings, I’m @matrixzephyr.  

I am a life long student, and a teacher of design, software, and making.  I am also a caregiver for two little old ladies and a colony of cats.

- I’m interested in 3d printing, cybersecurity, AI, gaming, chess, and all sorts of other stuff. 
- I’m currently learning Godot, Python, and making my first forays into Git.
